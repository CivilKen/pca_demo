# pca_demo
Use both eigenvector and SVD to demo principle component analysis(PCA).

1. Part of the pictures are contained in Aberdenn folder. If you need all pictures, please download the  zip file "Aberdeen.zip". These data are provided by Prof. Ian Craw, Aberdeen University. There are 415  pictures in total.

2. Run "img2mat.ipnb" to transform images into matrix format, and downsize the images. My computer doesn't have enough ability to compute the orignial images. If the conditioned is allowed, the step of downsize can be ignored.

3. "PCA_eigen.ipnb" is used to do PCA with eigenvector.

4. "PCA_eigenSVD.ipnb" is used to do PCA with SVD.
